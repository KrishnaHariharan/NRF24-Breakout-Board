# NRF24-Breakout-Board
This Project is about designing of a breakout board  PCB module for NRF24 using KICAD
Here I have created my own schematic and symbol for a nrf24 and added footprints to it. This breakout board will help nrf24 to be directly interfaced with arduino without any breadboard inbetwee.
